# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Topics 
This project covers the following topics:
- Data Wrangling
- Data Visualization
- Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Unsupervised Learning

## Motivation
1. Create two separate customer segmentations (using KMeans clustering) to split them into 3-5 clusters:
    - Based on demographics (only on the information from twn_customers)
    - Based on their banking behaviour. We take the following things into consideration:
        - Do they have a savings account? How much do they save?
        - Do they have a credit account? How much do they live in debt?
        - Are they making a lot of small transactions or few huge ones?
        
2. Visualize the created clusters using radar charts and compare them against each other

3. Visualize segmentations using scatter plots. We use PCA to be able to plot our observations in 2D.
